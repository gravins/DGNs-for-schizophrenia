# Deep Graph Networks for schizophrenia drug repurposing
This repository provides a reference implementation of our paper ***Controlling astrocyte-mediated synaptic pruning signals for schizophrenia drug repurposing with Deep Graph Networks***.

We will publish the code and data to replicate our results when the paper is accepted.
